### Work done

- Built a new public `dataviz-selector` skill to choose chart forms from a dataset plus question/hypothesis/story.
- Calibrated the skill from Karthik's Mint articles, local PowerPoints, Substack visualisation critiques, and one-at-a-time user feedback on chart-choice scenarios.
- Added hard guardrails against pie, donut, 3D, animated, interactive-first, gauge, radar/spider, and decorative infographic recommendations.
- Red-teamed the selector with out-of-sample prompts and rendered local examples from fuel-price, small-airport, and management PBT-miss data.
- Added the skill to this public repo, updated `sync-skills.py` to build/install multiple skills, generated Codex and Claude distributions, and pushed commit `df5c507`.
- Added repo documentation, skill docs, this devlog, and a short blog-style writeup about the process.
